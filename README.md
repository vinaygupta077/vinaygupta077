<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Vinay Gupta</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Python Developer from India</h3>


I’m a software engineer pursuing a master’s degree from R D Engineering College, Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh (AKTU). After finishing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering from JSS Academy of Technical Education Noida, Uttar Pradesh (AKTU), I’m looking for a career as a software developer. I’m building my skills in Data Structure, Python, C, Oops Concepts, HTML5, and MySQL.

Along with this, I’ve completed my diploma in the Information Technology branch from Government Polytechnic Ghaziabad, Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh (BTEUP). And also did my high school at Kendriya Vidyalaya Ballia, Uttar Pradesh (CBSE).

Currently living in New Delhi.

In the era of computers and digital technology, I’m always interested building up my logical thinking, and programming is one of the top best for me. Programming develops the skill of logical thinking, building algorithms, and problem-solving. This programming will teach me to solve non-trivial problems and think outside the box.

On the other side of me, I’m an athlete playing lots of games like Cricket, Football, Volleyball, and Badminton since high school and I have also been the captain of my college team. I love playing badminton or chess in my free time as it helps me unwind, relax as well as boosts my creativity and analytical thinking skills. And with this Listing music has been my favourite pastime since I was in high school.

Also, I like spending time in nature capturing all the wonderful moments of beauty with my camera. My favourite hobby is travelling because I love friends’ trips outings bring me the real adventure and thrill and also lots of fun into new places all by my friends’ group.
